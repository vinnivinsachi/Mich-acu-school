   <p>&quot;I received my pants in the mail yesterday and immediately tried them on. They fit perfectly!!! I have been thoroughly impressed with the customer service from VEdance and am amazed by how perfect the pants are. VEdance has kept me up to date when the pants had been shipped and was very helpful in providing a range for when the pants would arrive. I love the feel and look of the pants and would definitely order from VEdance again. Thank you!" ~Michael Z.</p>


		<p>&quot;I absolutely love my pinstripe dance pants! They&acute;re perfect when I attend social dance events and other dancers have come up to me complimenting the stripes.&quot; ~Serge D.</p>


		<p>&quot;These pant are awesome! The pinstripe is durable, and breathable. It dissipates heat very well. You can dance all day in them without breaking a sweat.&quot; ~Igor M.</p>
        
        <p>These pants are quality.  If clothes don't make the dancer, at least they make you look and feel good on the dance floor! ~Sam C.</p>
        <p>The material in Vincent's pants is like nothing I've seen before. Their weight makes them almost impossible to wrinkle, and they are really comfortable on top of that. ~Alex G.</p>
        
        <p>I purchased a pair of VEdance over two years ago and they still serve me incredibly well to this day. They are made of a very comfortable and light material, and they fit superbly. The pants are also cut very well and flow great. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. ~Daniel L.</p>
