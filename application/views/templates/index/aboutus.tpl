<p>
In the beginning, VEdance began with a single passion; to provide stylish, yet affordable, ballroom dance apparel to University students.<br/><br/>


The company began with just 10 pairs of latin dance pants arriving into Ann Arbor, Michigan and a dream that ballroom dancers across the United States would begin to wear their apparel during practices, social dances, and at every major dance competition.<br/><br/>


Founded in 2007, VEdance has since expanded their services and line of products. Not only do we provide pants to student ballroom organizations at several major Universities, but have also broadened our reach into private ballroom studios. Though only 3 years old, our initial 10 pairs seem like such a long time ago...<br/><br/>


Fear not. Know that when you wear dancewear produced by VEdance, that you are wearing a carefully crafted quality product that instills confidence and flair, no matter where you dance.<br/><br/>


Treat these pants well and they will do the same to you.<br/><br/>

Enjoy,<br/>

VEdance</p>
